[![Uses Mofo Standards](https://MozillaFoundation.github.io/mofo-standards/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/mofo-standards) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/network-pulse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/network-pulse)

This is a prototype to test a few ideas on how to gather a stream of things created by a network of people and organizations. The goals: keep friction low to maximize input; optimize signal and noise to surface interesting projects. The theory: do this well and more instances of collaboration and innovation will emerge from the network.
