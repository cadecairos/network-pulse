This is a prototype to test a few ideas on how to gather a stream of things created by a network of people and organizations. The goals: keep friction low to maximize input; optimize signal and noise to surface interesting projects. The theory: do this well and more instances of collaboration and innovation will emerge from the network.

## ðŸ”· v1, jQuery-based (now retired)

- See `v1` branch.

## ðŸ”· v2, React-based (current)

- Staging: https://network-pulse-staging.herokuapp.com
- Work is happening in the `master` branch.

### Requirements for Development

- `node`
- `npm`

### Setup for Development

- `git clone -b master https://github.com/mozilla/network-pulse.git`
- `cd network-pulse`
- `cp sample.env .env` (and modify values in sample.env so they match what you use for your local development env, see [environment variables section](https://github.com/mozilla/network-pulse#environment-variables))
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

### Environment Variables

#### `HOST`

The host you are using. e.g., `HOST=http://localhost`

#### `PORT`

The port number you are using. e.g., `PORT=3000`

#### `PULSE_API` (optional)

Default: `https://network-pulse-api-staging.herokuapp.com/`

URL to your local Pulse API instance (if you have one set up). e.g., `PULSE_API=http://test.example.com:8000`

To set up a local instance of Pulse API, follow instructions on https://github.com/mozilla/network-pulse-api/blob/master/README.md.

#### `ORIGIN` (auto-generated)

Derived variable based on `HOST` and `PORT` - overriding this yourself will do nothing.

#### `PROJECT_BATCH_SIZE` (optional)

Default: `24`

Number of projects you want to display as a batch. Make sure this number is divisible by 2 AND 3 so rows display evenly for different screen sizes.

### Deployment

#### Staging

URL: https://network-pulse-staging.herokuapp.com/

Updates to `master` branch automatically triggers staging deployment.

#### Production

URL: https://mzl.la/pulse

Deployment is done manually.

Concretely, we need to do a deployment rather than a "promotion" because there is a client-side bundle that gets built during deploy, and relies on environment variables at build time. As the staging environment and production environment differ in environment variables, we can't build on staging and then promote to production, as that would simply make our staging client "live".

To manually deploy production site:

1. Go to Heroku dashboard.
2. Find `network-pulse-production` app.
3. In the "Deploy" tab, scroll down to the "Manual deploy" section.
4. Deploy `master` branch. (see screencap below)
